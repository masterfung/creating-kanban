I KanBan
=======

###Overview

I KanBan is a react-powered application that utilizes ES6, Webpack, Flux
to create lanes and tasks. Each tasks can be dragged from one lane to another
and are easily editable. The current application uses localStorage to persist
but will work towards using a DB in the near future.
